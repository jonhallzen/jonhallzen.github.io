      <description>About Me Keith works hard to make die purchasing much easier for his customers. Twenty years of experience at Wilson help Keith to offer extensive technical knowledge of the converting process. A proven expertise in problem-solvingâ€”particularly for automotive, gasket and specialty die-cutting applications, helps him manage little details most competitors miss.
Away from work, Keith devotes his free time to hunting, fishing and working his farm in northern Missouri.</description>
