      <description>Force: Tooling&amp;rsquo;s Critical Balancing Act
In rotary die cutting, we apply enough force within a small area to cause the material to actually fail, or break. So understanding the principles behind force is essential for productivity and longer tool life.
Measuring Force
Different materials require varying amounts of force. At Wilson, we try to successfully cut at 75 to 100 lbs per one inch cross blade. The reason we use the cross-blade dimension is that this is the largest blade area in contact with the material.</description>

Not all Steel is Created Equal
Steel is an alloy of iron. An alloy takes a basic element—in this case, iron—and adds other elements to it to enhance certain properties. For applications in our industry, these additional elements include carbon, chromium, and vanadium.
